# neonband

One-shot, "GarageBand in the browser" — an experimental browser app that does multi-track audio from a single prompt to GPT5.

Neonband's goal is to make it ridiculously fast to sketch ideas: type a prompt (tempo, mood, instruments, style), hit generate, and get a playable/exportable track.
